# Py Forum

This is a forum made out of cgi scripts written in python for my 2nd semester of Intro to Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. It may or may not be still running [here](http://moe.stuy.edu/~vveytsman20/forum/). It was made to run in a sub-directory of a `public_html` folder where another subdirectory of said folder is called `www` and apache has read/write access to that folder. The old `forum.db`, which resided into that folder, has been copied into this directory for archival purposes.

Shout out to Mr. Brooks for being an amazing teacher.
